Having showcased how a web application can transform to a full-fledged desktop application, the acquired 
knowledge, results and future considerations for this specific artifact will be discussed in this chapter.\paragraph{}
As mentioned previously this artifact was inspired in terms of requirements by an already existing application. 
The development of this \acrshort{poc} has shown that desktop applications do have their advantages.
Use cases such as native context menus can be leveraged by developers to provide functionality a traditional 
web application simply cannot.\paragraph{}
As for this specific artifact the efficacy of using Electron and not a web-only application has to be questioned.
The possibilities provided by desktop applications and in this case Electron could not be fully leveraged 
because of the nature of this application.
Due to this tool being company specific and only used by employees during active work hours the implemented offline 
functionality only offers limited benefit over a web-only application as one can make the assumption
that an actively working employee has access to an internet connection.\paragraph{}
