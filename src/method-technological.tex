The application can be split into three distinct parts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The back-end API Used to fetch and save data.
    \item The front-end part using Angular\parencite{angularDocs}.
    \item The Electron part used to deploy the application and to offer offline functionality.
  \end{itemize}
The back-end uses a MongoDB database. The decision to choose MongoDB was taken because of the use
case: A time keeping application needs to be highly flexible.
Projects, Customers and the general company structure can change over time, necessitating 
a different database structure. 
MongoDB being a No-SQL database based on a JSON-like document structure as opposed 
to a relational database with a strictly defined structure. 
Such flexibility would greatly increase the future proofing of such an application.\paragraph{}
