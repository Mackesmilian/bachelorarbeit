Using the Design Science approach \parencite{VaishnaviVijayKuechler} an artifact will be developed using Electron.
Said artifact is a proof-of-concept application which will be used to gauge whether Electron would be an effective
solution in this specific and other different use cases. \paragraph{}
The application to be developed will be developed similarly to an already existing application.
Said application is a time keeping app developed by and used by Comm-Unity GmbH, a company specialising in e-government
software.
This web app is used by all employees to record the time worked based on factors such as customers, projects and other
internal, domain-specific aspects.\paragraph{}
The existing application is a web-only application developed using Vaadin 
(Vaadin is a server-side Java-only framework for web development)\parencite{vaadinDocs}.
By developing a similar application using Electron one can directly judge where the advantages and 
disadvantages of Electron lie.
