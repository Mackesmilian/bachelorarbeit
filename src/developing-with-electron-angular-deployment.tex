Packaging an Electron application can be carried out in two different ways which each have multiple options.
The first way is to use tooling such as electron-forge. 
The options and details with this approach will be explained later in this chapter.
The other way is to not use any tools and create a distribution manually.\paragraph{}
This can either be done by downloading the prebuilt Electron binaries and copying the 
source code into the correct location or by packaging source code into a source code archive.
The source code archive approach is beneficial in that it improves performance of file reads
on Windows. \parencite{electronDocsDist}\paragraph{}
