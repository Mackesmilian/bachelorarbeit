Naturally, in a rapidly evolving environment which software engineering and even more so 
web development is, developers have multiple approaches to solving the same issue, which 
in this case would be the development of a web application.
Having outlined why web applications have experienced such a rise in popularity and how
Electron presents a novel concept of overcoming web application's inherent shortcomings, 
one question arises in the context of software engineering and development:
What advantages and shortcomings does Electron present over traditional web applications? \paragraph{}
As relevant literature and resources are not available to answer this question a case study
will be conducted to answer this research question. 
The research question encompasses other questions with more specific objectives. 
These questions include: 
Which significant shortcoming and advantages exist for developers?
Which significant shortcoming and advantages exist for users?
Where can the advantages of each be best leveraged in a commercial environment?
The case study will follow the design priniciples laid out by \textcite{caseStudy}.
