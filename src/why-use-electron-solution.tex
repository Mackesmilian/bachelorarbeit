However, web applications do come with disadvantages. 
As described in \ref{subsubsec:desktop-applications} web apps have their shortcomings such as 
browser security preventing access to a user's file system or having no access as soon as the internet connection
fails.\paragraph{}
This is where frameworks such as Electron manage to strike the near-perfect balance between desktop application and web app.
For instance the drawback of not having access to a user's PC's file system does not apply to applications 
developed using electron, as the npm module \emph{osenv} can for example retrieve the user's home folder among 
other environment settings. \parencite{osenv}\par
Additionally, the disadvantage of having to consider different browsers (and versions thereof) are a non-issue
with electron because as Electron uses Chromium as outlined in \ref{subsec:what-is-electron}. 
Furthermore, internet access is not a requirement with Electron and therefore applications can have some offline
functionality as opposed to web apps.\par
These are some features and advantages of Electron, though not an exhaustive list. \parencite{electronDocs}\paragraph{}
Ultimately, it is at the developer's discretion which form of software to use. 
Desktop, web or frameworks such as Electron all have advantages and disadvantages and it is important to consider
which solution fits an application's and/or user's needs best.
