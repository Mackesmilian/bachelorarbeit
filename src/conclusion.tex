The results specific to this artifact have been described in the previous chapter. 
In this chapter the focus is a brief summary, more generalised results, a discussion of these results and 
future considerations.\paragraph{}
After analysing the shift from traditional software development in desktop environments towards
the web and outlining the reasons for this change in software engineering the various advantages 
of both models (desktop vs web) were explained. 
These reasons included financial ones as well as simpler after-sales support among other things.
After posing the question on how advantages from both areas can be combined into one, Electron 
was introduced as the solution. 
Explaining how Electron works and what it offers to developers and users alike an artifact (a 
\acrshort{poc} application) was defined. 
Requirements were adapted from a real-world application and defined after which development began.
During and after development the process was described and any issues encountered were outlined
and solved. 
After finishing development the focus shifted towards deployment of an Electron application
which resulted in a fully functioning platform-independent desktop application. 
Finally, the artifact and its development were analysed.\paragraph{}
