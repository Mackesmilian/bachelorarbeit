As described previously the front-end in this application is a single page application developed with Angular.
This chapter describes the process of integrating Angular with Electron, which entails a few Angular-specific 
details developers need to look out for.
During the course of this chapter these details will be discussed and explained and include points such 
as how to configure Electron and Angular to work alongside, how communication between the two works, and 
how event handling between Electron and Angular functions.
