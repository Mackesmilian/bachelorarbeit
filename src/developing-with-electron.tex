As previously described, the front-end component of this application is developed using Angular and Angular Material.
As these aspects are independent of Electron, the details of said implementation will be omitted, except the parts
where a direct communication between the front-end and angular takes place.\paragraph{}
During the course of this chapter a closer look will be taken on how an Electron application is to be developed.
That is to say, what the general structure should be, how it is set up and bootstrapped and finally how one can 
use Electron's functionality to cater to the needs specific to this application.
